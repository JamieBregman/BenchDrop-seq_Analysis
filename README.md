# BenchDrop-seq_Analysis

Scripts for processing and visualization of single-cell short-read and long-read BenchDrop-seq data.

Code used for the analysis in "BenchDrop-seq enables microfluidics-free single-cell long-read transcriptomics on a benchtop." A pre-print version of this work can be found on BioRxiv: [LINK]

Raw and processed BenchDrop-seq short-read and long-read sequencing data are avaialble through the NIH Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Accession ID: [ID HERE].
